# Full Cycle Docker Challenge

You are required to publish an image on Docker Hub. When we run:

```bash
docker run motaro/fullcycle
```

The output should be:

```bash
Full Cycle Rocks!!
```

1) As you can see, this image only prints the message as the final result.

2) Therefore, it's worth checking out the official Go language website to learn how to create a simple "Hello World" program.

```

3) Remember, Go has official images readily available, so it's a good idea to consult Docker Hub.
